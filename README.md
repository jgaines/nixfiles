# Nixfiles

This repo contains Nix files containing configuration for my home and work computers.  It's a WIP as I'm working towards capturing my current manual setups in Nix.

## Systems

The systems I intend to support in these scripts are:

| System              | OS                | Notes                            |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| jgaines-test-nixos  | NixOS             | VM for initial setup and testing |
| jgaines-Desktop     | Linux Mint 21.3   | Home computer                    |
| jgaines.localdomain | Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS | Work laptop                      |

My work laptop will eventually be the only one still running a stand-alone
Home-Manager on top of a non-NixOS.

### Alternates

Provide alternate front-ends to the standard nix commands.

* [devbox](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox) creates isolated, reproducible
  development environments that run anywhere. No Docker containers or Nix lang
  required.
* [devenv](https://devenv.sh/) - Fast, Declarative, Reproducible, and Composable
  Developer Environments using Nix
* [distrobox](https://distrobox.it/) - Simply put itâ€™s a fancy wrapper around
  podman, docker or lilipod to create and start containers highly integrated
  with the hosts.
* [Tvix](https://tvix.dev) is a new implementation of Nix, a purely-functional
  package manager. It aims to have a modular implementation, in which different
  components can be reused or replaced based on the use-case.

### Random Other Things

Random things I've encountered during my journey to nix enlightenment that I'd
like to look at later.
